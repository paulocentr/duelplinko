# Technical Glossary

## Core Concepts

**Provably Fair**
A system where game outcomes can be independently verified by the player using cryptographic proofs. The casino commits to a result before the bet is placed, preventing post-bet manipulation.

**Commit-Reveal Protocol**
A two-phase cryptographic scheme. In the *commit* phase, the server publishes a hash of its secret (server seed). In the *reveal* phase, after betting, the server discloses the actual seed. The player verifies that the hash of the revealed seed matches the earlier commitment.

**Determinism**
The property that identical inputs always produce identical outputs. In a provably fair system, the same (server seed, client seed, nonce) must always produce the same game result.

## Seed System

**Server Seed**
A secret value generated by the casino, used as the HMAC key. In Duel's implementation, this is a 64-character hexadecimal string representing 32 bytes of entropy. The server seed is hidden during active use and revealed only upon seed rotation.

**Client Seed**
A value set by the player (or auto-generated by the client) that is incorporated into the HMAC message. This ensures the player contributes entropy to the outcome. Players can change their client seed at any time via the Provably Fair panel.

**Nonce**
An auto-incrementing integer that starts at 0 for each new seed pair and increments by 1 with each bet. The nonce ensures that every bet under the same seed pair produces a unique HMAC input.

**Seed Pair**
The combination of a server seed and client seed that defines a betting session. A seed pair remains active until the player requests a seed rotation.

**Hashed Server Seed**
The SHA-256 hash of the hex-decoded server seed, published to the player before any bets are placed. This commitment prevents the server from changing the seed after seeing the player's bet.

**Seed Rotation**
The process of ending the current seed pair and starting a new one. Upon rotation, the previous server seed is revealed (enabling verification) and a new server seed hash is committed.

## Cryptographic Functions

**HMAC-SHA256**
Hash-based Message Authentication Code using SHA-256. Takes a key and a message, producing a 256-bit pseudorandom output. Used as the core RNG in Duel's Plinko implementation. HMAC-SHA256 is a pseudorandom function (PRF): its output is computationally indistinguishable from random without knowledge of the key.

**SHA-256**
Secure Hash Algorithm producing a 256-bit digest. Used to hash the server seed for the commitment phase. SHA-256 is collision-resistant (it is computationally infeasible to find two inputs with the same hash) and preimage-resistant (given a hash, it is infeasible to find the input).

**hexToBytes()**
A function that decodes a hexadecimal string into raw bytes. Each pair of hex characters becomes one byte. A 64-character hex string becomes 32 bytes. This is the correct way to prepare the server seed as an HMAC key — using UTF-8 encoding instead would produce 64 bytes and completely different HMAC outputs.

**Modulo Bias**
A statistical bias introduced when mapping a uniform random integer to a smaller range using the modulo operator. If the range does not evenly divide the input space, some outputs are slightly more likely than others. For Plinko's `value % 2`, there is zero modulo bias because 2 divides 2^32 evenly.

**Rejection Sampling**
A technique to eliminate modulo bias by discarding values that would cause non-uniform mapping. Used in Duel's Dice game (where the range is 10,001) but unnecessary for Plinko (where the range is 2).

## Verification Terms

**Verifier**
An independent program that re-computes game outcomes from the raw inputs (server seed, client seed, nonce). If the verifier's output matches the casino's reported outcome, the bet is verified as fair.

**Parity**
The agreement between the live game outcome and the verifier's re-computed outcome. 100% parity means every bet matched exactly.

**Reproducibility**
The ability to independently re-run all audit tests and arrive at the same conclusions. Requires access to the dataset, verification code, and test framework.

## Game Mechanics

**RNG (Random Number Generator)**
The algorithm that produces random outcomes. In Plinko, HMAC-SHA256 generates one pseudorandom value per row of pins.

**RTP (Return to Player)**
The percentage of wagered money returned to players over the long run. An RTP of 99.9% means the house retains 0.1% of all wagers on average. RTP is a statistical property — individual sessions can vary dramatically.

**House Edge**
The complement of RTP. A 99.9% RTP corresponds to a 0.1% house edge. This is the casino's expected profit margin per unit wagered.

**Multiplier**
The factor applied to the bet amount to determine the payout. In Plinko, each slot has a fixed multiplier determined by the risk level and row count. `win_amount = bet_amount × multiplier`.

**Effective Edge**
A per-bet field in Duel's API that reports the house edge applied to each individual bet. Standard bets show `effective_edge = 0.1` (0.1% edge); promotional "Zero Edge" bets show `effective_edge = 0`.

**Binomial Distribution**
The probability distribution B(n, 0.5) that describes the number of "right" bounces in n rows when each bounce has a 50% chance of going right. This is the theoretical distribution of Plinko slot positions.

## Audit Terms

**Exploit**
A method of breaking the fairness guarantees to gain an unfair advantage. Exploits can benefit the player (outcome prediction) or the casino (result manipulation).

**Chi-Squared Test**
A statistical test that measures how well an observed frequency distribution matches an expected distribution. Used to verify that Plinko slot distributions follow the expected binomial distribution.

**Standard Error**
A measure of the uncertainty in a statistical estimate. For RTP, the standard error indicates how much the observed RTP might differ from the theoretical RTP due to random sampling variation.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**
A computational method that uses repeated random sampling to estimate statistical properties. Used to verify that the simulated RTP converges to the theoretical RTP over millions of rounds.

**Entropy**
Randomness or unpredictability in a value. High entropy means the value is difficult to predict. The server seed's entropy comes from the casino's random number generator; the client seed's entropy comes from the player.
