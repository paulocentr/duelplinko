# Recommendations

## For Players

### 1. Set a Custom Client Seed

The default client seed is generated by Duel's client-side JavaScript. While this seed is genuinely incorporated into the outcome computation (we verified this), setting your own custom client seed provides stronger assurance that the server cannot precompute outcomes. Use a random string you generate yourself — even mashing your keyboard produces adequate randomness for this purpose.

### 2. Record Seed Commitments Before Betting

Before placing your first bet with a new seed pair, note (or screenshot) the hashed server seed displayed in the Provably Fair panel. This hash is your proof that the server committed to a specific seed before your bets. After seed rotation, you can verify that the revealed seed matches this hash.

If you forget to record the hash, you can still verify using the hash included in API responses — but recording it proactively provides the strongest guarantee.

### 3. Rotate Seeds Regularly

Seed rotation is the mechanism that enables verification. The server seed is only revealed upon rotation. If you never rotate, you can never verify your past bets. We recommend rotating at least every 50-100 bets.

After rotation, use the verification tool on Duel's fairness page (or build your own verifier) to check that your outcomes were correctly computed.

### 4. Understand Variance Before Playing High Risk

High risk configurations have extreme variance. The majority of outcomes pay 0.2x (80% loss), with rare edge-slot hits paying up to 1000x. In a short session, it is entirely normal to lose 90%+ of your balance on High risk — this does not indicate rigging. The same variance also means lucky streaks can produce dramatic winnings.

If you want more consistent returns, Low risk configurations offer similar long-term RTP (99.9%) with much lower variance. The win rate on Low risk is approximately 52%, compared to approximately 17% on High risk.

### 1. Publish Machine-Readable Multiplier Tables

Make the complete multiplier tables for all 27 Plinko configurations available via an API endpoint or as structured data on the fairness page. This would allow players and auditors to independently calculate theoretical RTP without needing to place real bets across every configuration.

Suggested implementation:
```
GET /api/v2/plinko/multipliers?risk_level=2&rows=8
→ { "multipliers": [13.0, 3.0, 1.3, 0.7, 0.403..., 0.7, 1.3, 3.0, 13.0] }
```

### 2. Implement Drand Integration

The `drand_round` and `drand_randomness` fields in the API response are currently null. Integrating with the [drand](https://drand.love/) distributed randomness beacon would provide:

- Publicly verifiable entropy for server seed generation
- A timestamp-anchored proof that the seed was generated at a specific time
- External assurance that the server seed is genuinely random (not chosen adversarially)

This would be a meaningful upgrade to the trust model, particularly for high-stakes players who want assurance beyond the commit-reveal protocol.

### 3. Implement a Commitment Transparency Log

Consider publishing seed commitments to a public, append-only log — for example, a signed transparency log similar to Certificate Transparency, or even a periodic on-chain anchor. This would provide:

- Permanent proof of what was committed, when
- Protection against claims of retroactive commitment changes
- Auditability for regulators and third-party fairness organizations

The log need not be on a blockchain — a signed, timestamped RSS feed or a simple append-only API endpoint with Merkle tree authentication would suffice.

### 4. Document the Effective Edge Mechanism

The `effective_edge` field in API responses is a positive transparency feature, but it is not documented on the fairness page. Consider adding an explanation of:

- What `effective_edge` means (the house margin applied to each bet)
- How the 0.1% standard edge is implemented (through multiplier calibration)
- How the "Zero Edge" promotional feature works (which bets receive 0% edge and why)

This documentation would help players understand exactly how the house edge operates and verify it independently.
